# Mandelbrot-Set
Rendering of the Mandelbrot Set using Processing. Most of the rendering is done in the fragment shader I wrote (with the algorithm from Wikipedia). The colours I used are from the Bob Ross colour palette.

To run this, you will have to download the entire MandelbrotSet folder. Open the pde file in Processing. I recommend putting Processing in shader mode for shader highlighting.

If you want to get your own palette from some text file containing RGB values (like the source code from this website https://flaviocopes.com/rgb-color-codes/), you can use the Python script which will generate the right code to paste into the pde and glsl files.
