# Mandelbrot-Set
Rendering of the Mandelbrot Set using Processing. Most of the rendering is done in the fragment shader I wrote (with the algorithm from Wikipedia). The colours I used are from the Bob Ross colour palette.

To run this, you will have to download the entire MandelbrotSet folder. Open the pde file in Processing. I recommend putting Processing in shader mode for shader highlighting.
